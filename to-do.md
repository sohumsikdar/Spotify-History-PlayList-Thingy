# Spotify History Playlist

1) Figure out the API - NEED TO FIGURE OAUTH
2) Maintain a DB? or maybe just a CSV lmao 
3) update the DB at every play - BY TONIGHT
4) for every month keep a frequency of played songs
5) get the top 50 most played songs and make a playlist
6) Merging for a year??? or do I keep a different one for a year?
